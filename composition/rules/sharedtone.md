# **Number of Shared Tones Rule:**

## What the rule controls:  

##### The rule controls the number of pitches that two adjacent chords in the progression must share. <br>

For example, if one chord contains an E and a G, and the next chord in the progression contains an E, then the chords share one pitch.

## Levels:

1. Adjacent chords must share all but 1 pitch
    1. Example: If the current chord is C major (C, E, G), then the next chord must have a C and E, an E and G, or a C and G in it.

2. Adjacent chords must share all but 2 pitches
    1. Example: If the current chord is C major (C, E, G), then the next chord must have only a C, an E, or a G in it. It cannot have a C and E, C and G, etc.
    
3. Adjacent chords must share all but 3 pitches
    1. Example: If the current chord is C major (C, E, G), then the next chord must not have a C, E, or G in it.

4. Adjacent chords must share all but 4 pitches (only applicable when num notes is greater than 3)
    1. Example: If the current chord is C dominant (C, E, G, B flat), then the next chord must not have a C, E, G or B flat in it.
    2. Example #2: If the current chord is C9 (C, E, G, B flat, D), then the next chord must have only one of the 5 notes in C9.

5. Adjacent chords must share all but 5 pitches (only applicable when num notes is greater than 4)
    1. Example: If the current chord is C9 (C, E, G, B flat, D), then the next chord must not have a C, E, G, B flat or D in it.
    2. Example #2: If the current chord is C11 (C, E, G, B flat, D, F), then the next chord must have only one of the 6 notes in C11.
    
6. Adjacent chords must share all but 6 pitches (only applicable when num notes is 6)
    1. Example: If the current chord is C11 (C, E, G, B flat, D, F), then the next chord must not have a C, E, G, B flat, D, or F in it.
