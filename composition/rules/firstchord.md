# **First Chord Rule:**

## What the rule controls:  

##### The rule controls the types of chords the progression can start with. <br>

## Levels:

1. (ON): All starting chords must have the input pitch as the bass note of the chord
    1. Example: If the first pitch in the melody is a C, then the bass note of the first chord must be a C
        1. C major [C, E, G] would be acceptable as C is in the bass
        2. C major in first inversion [E, G, C] wouldn't be acceptable as E would be in the bass 

2. (OFF): Starting chords do not have to have the pitch in the bass note of the chord
    1. All chords are allowed with this setting
