# **Base Note Rule:**

## What the rule controls:  

##### The rule controls what the base note of each chord can be. <br>

## Levels:

1. Bassline can only step (move a maximum of 2 semitones)
    1. Example: A D minor chord [D, F, A] can come after a C major chord [C, E, G] as  C to D is a step
        1. However a D minor chord in first inversion [F, A, D] cannot come after a C major chord as C to F is more than a step

2. Bassline can move a maximum of 4 semitones 
    1. Example: An E minor chord [E, G, B] can come after a C major chord [C, E, G] as  C to E is a leap of 4 semitones
        1. However an E minor chord in first inversion [G, B, E] cannot come after a C major chord as C to G is more than 4 semitones
3. Bassline can move a maximum of an octave
    1. All chords are allowed with this rule (provided they are in the proper octave)

## How to Input:

1.  Input integer values corresponding to the levels detailed above
    1. Example: If you want the bassline to only move in steps you would input, "1" corresponding to level 1
