# **Types of Intervals Rule:**

## What the rule controls:  

##### The rule controls the types of intervals that can make up the chords <br>

## Levels:

1. Chords can be made out of Minor 3rds, Major 3rds, Minor 6ths, and Major 6ths
    1. Example: C major (C, E, G) is an acceptable chord as C to E is a major 3rd and E to G is a minor 3rd.
        1. However a first inversion C major chord (G, C, E) isn't acceptable as G to C is a perfect 4th. 

2. Chords can be made out of 3rds (major or minor), 6ths (major or minor), Perfect 4ths, and Perfect 5ths
    1. Example: C major (C, E, G) is an acceptable chord as C to E is a major 3rd and E to G is a minor 3rd.
        1. A first inversion C major chord (G, C, E) is also acceptable as G to C is a perfect 4th.
    2. Example #2: The second inversion of F# diminshed (C, F#, A) is not acceptable as C to F# is a tritone

3. Chords can be made out of 3rds (major or minor), 6ths (major or minor), Perfect 4ths, Perfect 5ths, and Tritones
    1. Example: The second inversion of F# diminshed (C, F#, A) is acceptable as C to F# is a tritone and F# to A is a minor 3rd
    2. Example #2: C sus 2 (C, D, G) is not acceptable as C to D is a major 2nd
    
4. Chords can be made out of 3rds (major or minor), 6ths (major or minor), Perfect 4ths, Perfect 5ths, Tritones, 2nds (major or minor), and 7ths (major or minor)
    1. Example: C sus 2 is acceptable as C to D is a major 2nd and D to G is a perfect 4th
    2. All chord intervals are acceptable with this level
